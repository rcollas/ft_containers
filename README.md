# ft_containers
This is the first real C++ project at 42 school.\
It aims at learning three basic containers by recreating them from scratch.\
\
These containers are **stack, vector and map**.\
There's also some utility functions to implement :\
-iterators_traits\
-reverse_iterator\
-enable_if\
-is_integral\
-equal and lexicographical_compare\
-std::pair\
-std::make_pair\
\
Like all the other C++ projetcs of 42, the code must follow the **98 standard**. The boost library is forbidden.\
